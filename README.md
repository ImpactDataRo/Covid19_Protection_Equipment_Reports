Low-Quality Masks Infiltrate U.S. Coronavirus Supply**

 - Many imported masks fall short of N95 standards, tests show, putting workers on the front lines of battling the virus at risk
- U.S. regulators and state officials are finding a significant number of imported N95-style masks fall short of certification standards, complicating the response to the coronavirus crisis and potentially putting some front-line workers at greater risk.
- One mask that Niosh tested, sold in packaging bearing unauthorized Food and Drug Administration logos, filtered out as little as 35% of particles. Another, marked KN95, a Chinese standard similar to N95, had one sample test below 15%, far short of the 95% it advertised, Niosh said. KN95 and N95 both refer to standards that call for masks to block 95% of very small particles.
- The Niosh tests, combined with recalls and additional testing from multiple states, show that millions of substandard masks have been imported from China and other countries as the need for protective gear for workers confronting the pandemic has skyrocketed.
- With domestic production and stockpiles falling far short of demand, the tests suggest a high risk that hospitals, local authorities and companies are in many cases paying steep prices for substandard medical gear of uncertain provenance.
- Officials in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts and Missouri said they found many imported masks failed quality tests, too. Massachusetts recently warned police and fire departments that some Chinese-made masks distributed by the state had performed well below par in tests conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

China seizes more than 89 million sub-standard face masks**

- As of last Friday, China's market regulators had inspected nearly 16 million businesses and seized more than 89 million masks and 418,000 pieces of protective gear, said Ms Gan Lin, deputy director of the State Administration of Market Regulation, at a press briefing.
- In an effort to eliminate poor-quality products, China released new rules last Saturday stating that even non-medical masks must meet both national and international quality standards.
- Exporters must file a written declaration that their medical products meet the safety requirements of the destination country, the ministry of commerce said.
- According to official figures, China's daily mask production has exceeded 116 million. In the first two months of the year, a staggering 8,950 new manufacturers started producing masks in China, according to business data platform Tianyancha.
- Despite the crackdown, businesses were continuing with illicit production of medical equipment since it was a way to earn "quick money", Mr Jin Hai, a Chinese Customs official, said. Over 31.6 million faulty masks and 509,000 protective suits destined for export had been seized by officials as of mid-April.

 On China’s Face Mask Markets**

- In March, China exported almost 4 billion masks, 37.5 million gowns and isolation suits, 16,000 ventilators and almost 4 million coronavirus testing kits, customs officials revealed earlier in April, with the manufacturing overdrive burning through stockpiles of chemicals and petrochemicals needed to make the fabrics.
- Beijing’s efforts to take some of steam out of a market that was overheating and leading to a series of public relations disasters overseas.
- Only approved manufacturers have guaranteed access to the certified melt-blown fabric made by well-known companies such as Sinopec, China’s state-owned oil company, while most private manufacturers are left to find their own sources.

Canada: 1 million respirators acquired from China unfit for coronavirus fight**

- Canada's public health authority says around 1 million KN95 respirators acquired from China have failed to meet federal Covid-19 standards for use by front-line health professionals.
- The rejected masks may still be useful, but away from hospitals.

Chaos, Sky-High Prices in China’s Mask Market**
- The [face masks / respirators] market has quickly become overrun with profiteering middlemen, bidding wars, skyrocketing prices and concerns about the goods’ quality.
- As of February, a registry of medical device companies maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration listed only 40 or so respirator products. Since then the list has grown to more than 1,300 – with about 90% of the new products tied to suppliers with addresses in China.
- [Companies with no previous experience in the manufacturing of medical products, including] manufacturers of everything from toys and tennis shoes, to electronics and lingerie, began churning out respirators, surgical masks, rubber gloves and more to cash in on surging global demand. Even small manufacturers, with as few as 50 people, set up workshops or added production lines, often aided by government-backed loans and reduced registration requirements.
- Some new factories have struggled to meet quality standards. Last month, the Dutch government recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks, Spain scrapped nearly 60,000 Chinese testing kits that had a high failure rate, and Slovakia’s Prime Minister Igor Matovic complained that a shipment of more than 1 million Covid-19 testing kits from China was so ineffective it should “be thrown straight into the Danube.”
- China has attempted to crack down on sub-par suppliers, counterfeiters and unscrupulous middlemen. The government has investigated more than 1,000 recent cases of companies making fake or unreliable equipment and seized nearly 50 million face masks. On Friday, government officials announced a plan for China’s customs agency to inspect every shipment of medical respirators, medical protective clothing and other equipment before export.
- Instead of buying equipment from new Chinese factories (e.g.: companies that used to make cosmetics and toys and now have turned into mask producers) more experienced buyers are examining thoroughly  through dozens of sites that had previously made medical facial guards.
- In normal times, [proper quality] vetting process for new manufacturers involves months of due diligence.

Quality Control Problems with Exports from China**

- Beijing has tightened export standards in recent days, including quality checks at customs and requiring domestic certification as well as foreign licenses for medical products shipped abroad. Previously, exported medical products only had to have the certifications in receiving countries, such as the European Union’s CE certification, which could be easily counterfeited in China.
- The desperation of states, nations, hospitals and individuals competing worldwide, shelling out millions of dollars to get medical gear as people die by the thousands each day, has created a scammer’s paradise.
Britain reportedly bought 3.5 million antibody tests from two Chinese companies, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co. and Hangzhou AllTest Biotech Co. Only one of those, Wondfo, was on the Chinese National Medical Products Administration’s list of authorized test kits.
- The company that Spain bought faulty test kits from, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., was also not on the list of nationally authorized suppliers. The Spanish government reportedly acquired the test kits through a middleman who produced documentation showing that Shenzhen Bioeasy had CE certification.
 - Chinese diplomats have tried to distance the government from the companies selling faulty medical products, while also asserting that due diligence is the buyer’s responsibility.  “We want to remind everyone to double-check the instructions for use to make sure what they purchase can serve their intended purposes and avoid making mistakes in a rush,” said Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a recent news briefing.
- China is worried about low-quality medical products damaging its image. On April 6, customs authorities announced they’d confiscated more than 11 million unregistered medical products within one week, including 9.94 million masks, 144,000 protective gowns, more than a million testing kits and 24,000 infrared thermometers.
- The Coronavirus has exposed the world’s dependence on China and that country’s problems with quality control.


**11-April-2020 - New York Times:  China Delays Mask and Ventilator Exports After Quality Complaints**

- New customs policy introduced in China after a series of complaints from Europe that medical supplies from China had quality problems. Chinese officials have countered that many of the complaints involved industrial respirators that were purchased for medical use but were not designed to meet those standards.
- The new rules cover China’s exports in 11 categories: medical respirators and surgical masks, medical protective clothing, infrared thermometers, ventilators, surgical caps, medical goggles, medical gloves, medical shoe covers, patient monitors, medical disinfection towels and medical disinfectants.

Philadelphia, New York facing problems with counterfeits, quality checks of imports from China** 

- Before this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had 38 companies registered as suppliers of N95 masks. 
- An additional 1,367 registered with the FDA in 2020, according to agency data. 
- Untested newcomers to the field, many of them in China, are suddenly producing equipment, and distributors are seeking new sources as established ones run out of stock.
- Robert Kushner is among the American importers who recently entered the mask business. His company, UT Brands of Orange County, Calif., had since 1995 imported home goods for stores like Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl’s. His first order of 100,000 masks is en route, Kushner said, but he had to cancel an order for 500,000 masks after learning they were counterfeits. His connections in China are doing quality checks where possible. But, Kushner said, they’re liable to hear, “I’ve got a line out the door of people with cash who aren’t asking questions of me.”

China ramps up Coronavirus gear, yet struggles to police it**

- One man made fake Honeywell N95 respirators at a makeshift factory on a farm. Pharmacies sold ineffective knockoffs of a Chinese version of Clorox. In one Chinese province, authorities seized more than seven million masks that were substandard, mislabeled or counterfeited.
- China’s vast manufacturing machine has moved into overdrive to supply the country and the world with masks, testing kits, respirators and other gear to fight the global coronavirus pandemic. Companies big and small that once manufactured other items are now in the business of making anti-coronavirus gear — and regulators in China are struggling to enforce standards while encouraging the flow.
- “Every time when something major happens in society like this virus outbreak, there is a lot of demand and different kinds of companies try to get in,” said Cody Zhang, the chief executive officer of a start-up seeking certification for its own products, including a disinfecting robot. “It becomes hard at the beginning to figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad.”
- Regulators have shut down tens of thousands of shops making fake masks, faulty thermal temperature guns and disinfectants that don’t work, according to government disclosures.  
- Thousands of companies and individuals have been punished for offenses like making counterfeits or price gouging, according to China’s State Administration for Market Regulation, which oversees standards and testing.
- Police have been sent out to raid the operations of counterfeiters across China. In the city of Chongqing, some 88,500 officers filed hundreds of cases. Many of those were related to poor quality protective gear. Others included the manufacturing of counterfeit drugs and medical devices.


**01-April-2020 - New York Times:  China ramps up Coronavirus gear, yet struggles to police it**

- China [the world’s biggest face mask producer] has ramped up mask production to nearly 12 times its earlier level of 10 million a day.
- Some factories make products of suspect quality, and some sellers will even try to swindle buyers.
- Mask traders in Shanghai say they have wasted time bargaining over rumored caches of masks before concluding that the only reliable suppliers are top managers at the factories themselves. “I’m still being put in touch with people who claim to have caches of 3M-branded masks,” Mr. Noah said. “But I’m skeptical such caches exist after looking at four or five phantom caches.”


**03-April-2020 - New York Times:   
Scams and prices soaring in the Mask Markets**

- Hospitals, governments, do-gooders and hucksters are all competing. Scams and prices are soaring.
States and hospitals, whose typical suppliers are overwhelmed and overextended, have little experience negotiating directly with the Chinese supply chain. Thousands of middlemen — entrepreneurs, do-gooders and profiteers — have rushed to fill the void.
- That frenzy has created a mess of confusion, according to interviews with hospitals, factories and mask buyers. Production of masks is soaring, but so are scams, logistical hurdles and, of course, prices.
- Hospitals are prepared to pay more for masks, but don't not want to buy counterfeit gear. “You’re in this uncharted territory where you’re struggling to just at least validate,” Mr. Bonetti said. “The last thing we want to do is put product on a clinician that is not going to protect them.”


**03-April-2020 - EuroNews:   
Netherlands recalls hundreds of thousands of defective Chinese face masks**

- The fake masks had a KN95 certification indicating that they should filter above 95% of particles.
- According to state broadcaster NOS, the recall concerns 600,000 masks.


**01-April-2020 - CNN:   
N95 masks are in short supply -- and scammers know it**

- Across the world, N95 masks are in short supply, as they're considered the gold standard of respirator masks. They're able to filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles from the air, including bacteria and viruses -- making them a crucial piece of equipment for doctors and nurses as they race to treat tens of thousands of coronavirus-infected patients in the United States.
- That degree of protection is guaranteed, however, only with federally tested and certified masks that fit snugly around the nose and mouth -- creating a seal to minimize the number of particles that bypass the filter through gaps between the user's skin and the respirator, according to the CDC. 
- Counterfeit respirators "can compromise the safety of anyone who uses them, including healthcare providers," the CDC told CNN Business.
- Supply chain experts say they aren't surprised about fake masks popping up -- and they expect the problem to accelerate.
 - Middlemen might not even have any inventory initially. "They try to make a deal first with businesses that are trying to procure legitimate product, like the N95 mask. After they get a deal they then try to source the counterfeit version of the product."


**17-April-2020 - WGN:   Illinois spent $17 million on masks from China that do not meet quality standards for medical use**

- State spending records reveal Illinois has spent nearly $17 million buying the KN95 masks.
Officials in Missouri are recalling thousands of KN95 masks after testing by the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services over the weekend found some did not meet standards for medical use.
- An alert from the Illinois Department of Public Health followed, saying the KN95 masks may not meet performance standards and counterfeit masks are “flooding the marketplace.”
- The department recommends agencies remove any KN95 masks that have already been received.
- The Illinois Department of Public Health is advising hospital staff not to use the KN95 masks during higher-risk environments,  and rely on N95 masks instead.
